# ðŸš«Beta Documentation 

> Documenting the path i took for students aiming to pick the same education. 

This theme serves as the starting point for the documentation. I decided to improve the user experience by using a theme with a dark/light feature.

# Contribution
## Improve this project
Possibly more than ever before, I will require contributions. I'll keep adding useful content and asking classmates, teachers, and anyone else who can help to get this project to a point where you only need your computer to finish your degree.
As the project progresses, I'll include a HOW-TO contribution. 

Please keep an eye on the updated repository mentioned above. **Current Docs Closed.**
